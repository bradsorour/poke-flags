## Coding Challenge 5: PokéFlags
In an effort to foster global peace and harmony, the United Nations is launching a new project. The idea is that every country in the world chooses a Pokémon that best matches that countryʼs flag, to use as a mascot.

Goal: given a 2-letter ISO code for a country, return the name and Pokédex ID of the Pokémon character which has the best colour match to that countryʼs flag.

### Constraints

* There are 200 sovereign countries in the world (193 UN members + 7)
* You may limit to the first 6 generations of Pokémon (721 species)
* You can use whatever data sources you want
* In the event of multiple similar matches, you might want to consider other
factors, such as the stats or type of the Pokémon in relation to the size or nature of the country in question

### Input

* A single two-letter ISO country code, e.g. GB for the United Kingdom.

### Output

* At minimum: country iso code, numeric Pokédex ID, Pokémon name
* Alternatives such as a graphical view of the flag and Pokémon are
encouraged

### Success criteria and judging
On the day, a random list of 10 countries will be provided. Participants must identify the appropriate Pokémon for each of the provided countries.

The team members present will vote, for each country, as to which solution has the best answer in their subjective judgement based on all criteria given. For each country, a single winner will get 3 points, if there are 2 winners tied they get 2 points, more than 2 tied get 1 point.

The winner will be the participant with the most points across all ten countries.
